    In this article, we will know the HTML Paragraphs, & its basic implementation through the examples. The  tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we donâ€™t use the closing tag i.e, , but this may raise unexpected results.
